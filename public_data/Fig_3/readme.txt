We provide data needed of neutron stars in genenral relativity additional with the trace of energy-momentum tensor.
The specific EOS and the stability are easily get from the file name (st=stable; us=unstale).

ec: central mass density
R: stellar radius
M: ADM mass
Mb: baryonic mass
rT: the radius of trace-sign-reversed core
